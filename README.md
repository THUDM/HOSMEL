# HOSMEL

## Usage

Our toolkit allows 3 different levels of usages

### Ready-to-Use

If you are not interested to change our default setup, follow the steps of [Mention Filtering](### Mention Filtering), [Mention Detection](Mention Detection), [Disambiguation By Subtitle](### Disambiguation By Subtitle), and [Disambiguation By Relation](Disambiguation By Relation). A [Live demonstration](#ld) using the same structure is also available.

### Partial

We know some users might prefer to design their own entity disambiguation framework or has other needs, some level of high quality candidate entity retrieval is still required. As a result, we support partial usage. To do this, make sure you complete the setups(which is only downloading and extracting zip files), simply import the corresponding part of the toolkit, and use it in your preferred manner. For better illustration a sample usage for the complete pipeline could be found in

See [setups](#su) for more information.

### Easy-to-Change

To train your own module, we recommend to copy the relation module, ideally, for training you only need to make sure your training data satisfies the form of

```json
{
    "sentence": "The input text", 
    "Label": int(k) # Label id showing targetk is the correct value, 
    "mention": "the mention of the entity", # Note: for mention detection, leave the mention empty and make the targets as your candidate mentions
    "target0": "A", # The four candidate values 
    "target1": "B",
    "target2": "C",
    "target3": "D"
}
```

Then reimplement the $generatePair$ method in the `apply{feature}.py` file for infer.

## <span id="su">Setting Up</span>

### dependencies

Our method requires a few python based dependencies:

```bash
pip install flask torch tqdm pickle json pyahocorasick datasets
```

Make sure you have all the dependencies installed to access all of our methods.

### Mention Filtering

First Download [TriMention.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12w12GH5XEVGKYoaWm_sXVFHGFOSFJHnu/view?usp=sharing) to the `TriMention` directory, then simply extract the zip packages. You should see your directory to look like,

```bash
TriMention/
├── bdi2relation.pkl
├── mention.py
├── nameTri
├── subList.json
└── web.py
```

The `TriMention` folder not only includes the basic Trie tree, it also comes with subtitle and relationship data which would be used for later sections. We separate the data-loading and processing for the consideration of better development experience since loading such data takes a large amount of time. To load the datas simply run

```bash
python mention.py
```

### Mention Detection

Download the [MD_checkpoint.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pMqN63yy9S9NZJWRV41bc-dASRndLwtr/view?usp=sharing) file and extract it to the `MCMention/model` folder. It should look like

```bash
MCMention/
├── applyMention.py
├── model
│   ├── config.json
│   ├── pytorch_model.bin
│   ├── special_tokens_map.json
│   ├── tokenizer_config.json
│   └── vocab.txt
├── preprocessData.py
└── train.py
```

### Disambiguation By Subtitle

Download the [SD_checkpoint.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BZphOj8rS7qHZA3wWz0vcY3H_qbCjTGK/view?usp=sharing) to the `model` directory under `MCSubtitle`. Then unzip it. The final directory should look like

```bash
MCSubtitle/
├── applySubtitle.py
├── model
│   ├── config.json
│   ├── pytorch_model.bin
│   ├── special_tokens_map.json
│   ├── tokenizer.json
│   ├── tokenizer_config.json
│   └── vocab.txt
├── preprocessData.py
└── train.py
```

### Disambiguation By Relation

Download the [RD_checkpoint.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xKvPx0LY6XgVXY7wtSmUwk2iMfBm-9qw/view?usp=sharing) to `MCRelation/model/`, and unzip to get

```bash
MCRelation/
├── applyRelation.py
├── model
│   ├── config.json
│   ├── pytorch_model.bin
│   ├── special_tokens_map.json
│   ├── tokenizer.json
│   ├── tokenizer_config.json
│   └── vocab.txt
├── preprocessData.py
└── train.py
```

## Launching HOSMEL

To launch the complete HOSMEL, we provide a flask based backend, simply run it as

```bash
python backend.py
```
